## New UI

Birch departs from my previous apps in two respects.

First it no longer uses a purely "plain text" user interface. For example to
make text bold in FoldingText you would souround it with **'s. In Birch to
make text bold you select it and issue the Command-B "Bold" command.



## A New Approach

I've long thought that an outline model user interface was an esentail part of
the solution that I've been working toward. But in my past attempts I also
though that a pure plain text editor user interface was also esential.
Unfortunaly these two goals conflicted and my attempts to resolve the conflict
added lots of complexity to the project.

In my previous attempts (TaskPaper and FoldingText) the entire inteface was
based around a syntax highlighting plain text editor. Behind the scenes an
outline model was built and maintained based on plain text formatting rules.
Unfortunatly for every new feature a new syntax needed to be invented, and
this got out of hand. The underlying outline structure was no longer easy to
see and manipulate, and so lost its power.

The new approach that I'm taking

## A New Platform

It is a signifigant change in a number of respects, let me
first providate some background.

My interests "the goal" have been pretty consistent, if not consistently
executed throughout

The goal has always been pretty simple. Computers should be a great place to
think and process ideas, but often all this greatness is hidden behind to much

Birch is a package that extends the [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io) to
also edit outlines.
